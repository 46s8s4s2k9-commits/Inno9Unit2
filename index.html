            <h2>Reconnaissance Technology: The Eyes of the Cold War</h2>
            <h3>U-2 Spy Plane Technology</h3>
            <p>The Lockheed U-2 "Dragon Lady" represented a breakthrough in aerial reconnaissance that made the crisis manageable rather than a surprise attack. The aircraft could fly at 70,000 feet—beyond the reach of Soviet interceptors and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), though this assumption proved dangerously flawed.</p>
            <p><strong>Technical Specifications:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Camera system: The Hycon Model 73B "B camera" could identify objects as small as 2.5 feet from 60,000 feet altitude</li>
                <li>Intelligence value: October 14, 1962 U-2 photographs provided the first definitive proof of Soviet medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) in Cuba, triggering the crisis response</li>
                <li>Tragic cost: Major Rudolf Anderson Jr. was shot down in his U-2 on October 27, 1962, demonstrating that the "invulnerable" reconnaissance platform had become vulnerable to Soviet S-75 Dvina (SA-2) missiles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The U-2's technological superiority created a false sense of security. The CIA's Office of National Estimates had assumed Soviet radar couldn't track the aircraft, but Russian systems proved more capable than anticipated. This intelligence failure nearly escalated the crisis when a U-2 accidentally strayed into Soviet airspace on October 27, triggering MiG interception attempts and risking nuclear war.</p>

            <h3>CORONA Satellite Reconnaissance</h3>
            <p>While U-2s provided tactical intelligence during the crisis, the CORONA satellite program represented the strategic reconnaissance revolution that defined Cold War intelligence science.</p>
            <p><strong>Scientific Breakthrough:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>First successful mission: August 1960, just two months after the U-2 incident with Gary Powers</li>
                <li>Intelligence yield: CORONA's first mission captured more imagery than all previous U-2 flights combined</li>
                <li>Technical innovation: The system required launching a large camera into orbit, photographing targets, returning film capsules by parachute, and mid-air retrieval over the Pacific</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The CIA's Directorate of Science & Technology managed CORONA as a joint effort with the Air Force, demonstrating how scientific expertise became institutionalized within intelligence agencies. Photointerpreters at the National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) analyzed imagery, using comparative analysis to identify Soviet missile deployments based on technical specifications provided by double agent Oleg Penkovsky.</p>​
            <p>CORONA's scientific precision eliminated the "missile gap" hysteria by providing accurate counts of Soviet ICBMs, revealing they were significantly behind U.S. capabilities. This data-driven intelligence fundamentally altered strategic planning and arms control negotiations.​</p>
